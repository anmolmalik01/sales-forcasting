## Installation

To run the project, you will need Jupyter Notebook and project dependencies installed.

Jupyter Notebook installation:
```
pip install notebook
```

Dependencies installation:
```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file "Customer_Segmentation.ipynb."
3. Download the dataset. 
4. Execute the cells in the notebook to run the analysis and clustering on the provided dataset.

## Data

The dataset used for this project is taken from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about supermarket sales and includes features such as Customer ID, Gender, Age, Income, Spending Score, etc. You can find the dataset at the following link: [Kaggle Supermarket Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales)



## Customer Segmentation Methodology
In this project, we use various clustering algorithms such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, or DBSCAN to group customers based on their spending behavior. The choice of clustering algorithm can be found in the Jupyter Notebook, along with the reasons for selecting it.


## Conclusion

The customer segmentation analysis provides valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences. The conclusions drawn from this analysis can be used for targeted marketing, product recommendations, and personalized customer experiences.

## Future Work

Possible areas for future work include experimenting with different clustering algorithms, exploring additional features, or integrating the segmentation results into business strategies.
